# stamford-bridge

This game is a final project for my Introduction to Computer Game Design & Development course. 

In Stamford Bridge, you play as a lone Viking defending the river crossing from the English army. The King of Norway is behind regrouping his men, and it's your job to hold the bridge as long as possible!
